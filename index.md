## UP Version Control System

### Project Description
My idea for this project is to make something similar to git in terms of functionality to better understand how git works and to further my personal programming skills. Obviously git is a tool that has been perfected for many years by many smart people so I won't be able to implement anything anywhere close to what git is like now, but my goal is to implement a few main features of git to have a basic version control system.

### Project Design
I am planning on using Python to build this system because there are a lot of built in tools for Python that give you easy access to the file system and structure. I am also in the process of learning Python so it will give me a project to work on to further my Python skills.

The use cases for this project are to be able to show the differences between files, keep those differences stored in a project directory, and navigate between them, so as to be able to work on different iterations of a file without breaking all files.

### Project Schedule
I plan on having the diff between files completed in 2 weeks from now (3/27). I have the config directory structure already set up so that will be changing as I work on the project. I plan on being able to move between different versions of a file completed by mid-April (4/17). The final project will be two things: the version control system from the command line, and a GitHub-like user interface to show the files and diffs between files on a browser.

### Project Justification
I think my project is interesting because git is very interesting to me. Git is such an integral part of the software development lifecycle and how it works internally is extremely interesting to me. Like I said earlier, my product won't be very different in terms of general idea from git, as this is more of a learning experience project. I am trying to make it more user friendly than git for newer developers to get them to understand why a version control system is helpful for writing software. I think that the complexity of this project will be more than enough to meet the requirement, and it will also meet the networking requirement (the GitHub-like UI).
